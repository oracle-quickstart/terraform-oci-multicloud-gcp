## Overview

A repository contains a collection of [terraform modules](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules) and templates that helps an Google Cloud administrator configure an Google Cloud environment for Oracle Database@Google and provision database related components in Google Cloud.

A user can apply the terraform plans from any computer that has connectivity to both Google Cloud and OCI.
